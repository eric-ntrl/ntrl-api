## Iteration Log

### Setup (2025-01-12)
- Created PRD: docs/prd/article-neutralization-v1.md
- Created prd.json with 18 user stories across 5 phases
- Stored canon: docs/canon/neutralization-canon-v1.md
- Stored content spec: docs/canon/content-spec-v1.md
- Integrated deterministic grader: app/services/grader.py
- Grader spec: app/data/grader_spec_v1.json

### Story 1.1 - Integrate deterministic grader (COMPLETE)
- Verified grader.py exists at app/services/grader.py
- Verified grader_spec_v1.json exists at app/data/grader_spec_v1.json with all deterministic canon rules
- Confirmed `from app.services.grader import grade` works
- Confirmed grade() returns {overall_pass: bool, results: list}
- Note: Some canon rules (A2, A6, B4, B5, C1, C3, C4, D4) require semantic/LLM analysis - these are intentionally not in the deterministic grader

### Story 1.2 - Create /v1/grade endpoint (COMPLETE)
- Created app/schemas/grading.py with GradeRequest, GradeResponse, RuleResult schemas
- Added POST /v1/grade endpoint to app/routers/admin.py
- Endpoint accepts original_text, neutral_text, original_headline, neutral_headline
- Returns {overall_pass, results} from deterministic grader
- FastAPI returns 422 validation error for missing required fields (standard behavior)

**Next**: Story 1.3 - Create LLM quality scorer service
