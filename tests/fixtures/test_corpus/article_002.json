Nineteen Republican senators joined all 50 Democrats in supporting the measure.\n\nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio, a lead Republican negotiator, called the bill \"a historic investment in American infrastructure.\" Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another key negotiator, said the legislation \"will create jobs and strengthen our economy.\"\n\nThe bill allocates $110 billion for roads and bridges, $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $65 billion for broadband expansion, and $55 billion for clean water infrastructure.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated she will not bring the bill to a vote until the Senate also passes a larger budget reconciliation package. The timeline for House consideration remains uncertain.",
