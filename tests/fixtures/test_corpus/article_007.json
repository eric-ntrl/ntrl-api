  "original_body": "Microsoft announced plans to invest $10 billion in expanding its Azure cloud infrastructure over the next three years, with a focus on artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe company will build new data centers in Texas, Georgia, and Wisconsin, creating an estimated 5,000 jobs. The expansion will increase Microsoft's computing capacity for AI workloads by approximately 40%.\n\n\"Enterprise demand for AI services continues to grow rapidly,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during the company's quarterly earnings call. \"This investment positions Azure to meet that demand.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as Microsoft competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud for market share in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure market. Azure currently holds approximately 23% of the global cloud market.\n\nConstruction on the new facilities is expected to begin in early 2025, with the first data center operational by late 2026.",
