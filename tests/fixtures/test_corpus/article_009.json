  "original_body": "The United Nations Climate Change Conference concluded Saturday with 197 nations agreeing to new emissions reduction targets and a framework for climate finance.\n\nThe agreement commits developed nations to mobilize $100 billion annually for climate adaptation in developing countries through 2030. Participating countries also pledged to submit updated nationally determined contributions by 2025.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the outcome \"a step forward, though much work remains.\" He noted that current commitments still fall short of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nKey provisions of the agreement include a global methane reduction target of 30% by 2030, a commitment to phase down coal power generation, and new transparency requirements for emissions reporting.\n\nChina, the world's largest emitter, agreed to accelerate its timeline for peak emissions, though it did not commit to a specific date earlier than the previously announced 2030 target. The United States reaffirmed its goal of 50-52% emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.\n\nEnvironmental groups offered mixed reactions. Greenpeace International called the agreement \"insufficient to address the scale of the climate crisis,\" while the World Resources Institute described it as \"meaningful progress in a challenging geopolitical environment.\"\n\nThe next major climate summit is scheduled for November 2025 in Brazil, where nations will review progress on implementation. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pledged to make Amazon deforestation a central topic.\n\nScientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release an updated assessment of global emissions trajectories in early 2025, which will inform negotiations going forward.",
