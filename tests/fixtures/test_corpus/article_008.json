  "original_body": "Global supply chain pressures have eased significantly over the past quarter, with shipping container rates falling to their lowest levels since early 2021, according to new industry data.\n\nThe Drewry World Container Index, which tracks freight rates on major shipping routes, declined 75% from its peak in September 2021. Rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles now average $2,100 per 40-foot container, down from over $12,000 at the height of pandemic-era disruptions.\n\n\"We're seeing a normalization of global trade flows,\" said Lars Jensen, CEO of container shipping consultancy Vespucci Maritime. \"Port congestion has largely cleared, and capacity is now adequate to meet demand.\"\n\nMajor retailers including Walmart and Target have reported improved inventory positions and reduced logistics costs. However, some economists caution that the improvement partly reflects weakening consumer demand rather than purely supply-side gains.\n\nThe Baltic Dry Index, which measures bulk commodity shipping costs, has also declined 40% from its 2022 highs, suggesting broader improvement in maritime logistics.\n\nFactory output in key manufacturing hubs including China's Guangdong province has stabilized, with lead times for electronic components returning to pre-pandemic norms. Semiconductor availability has improved substantially, though some specialty chips remain in short supply.\n\nAnalysts expect shipping rates to remain relatively stable through 2024, barring major geopolitical disruptions or unexpected demand surges. The industry continues to add new vessel capacity, with 2.4 million TEUs of new container ships scheduled for delivery this year.\n\nRetailers are using the improved conditions to rebuild safety stock levels depleted during the supply crunch. Many companies are also diversifying their supplier bases to reduce future vulnerability.",
