## 2. Description of Service

### 2.1 What NTRL Does

NTRL is a news reading application that processes publicly available news articles to remove manipulative language. The App:

- Ingests news articles from public RSS feeds published by established news organizations.
- Applies AI-powered neutralization to identify and remove manipulative language, including clickbait headlines, emotional triggers, hype language, agenda framing, and other forms of linguistic manipulation.
- Presents articles in three views: Brief (summary), Full (neutralized article), and Ntrl (transparency view showing all changes made).
- Organizes content across 10 categories: World, U.S., Local, Business, Technology, Science, Health, Environment, Sports, and Culture.

### 2.2 What NTRL Does NOT Do

NTRL does **not**:

- Produce original reporting or journalism.
- Fact-check, verify, or validate the accuracy of claims within articles.
- Label, classify, or score articles for political bias or opinion.
- Balance viewpoints or provide counter-narratives.
- Endorse, recommend, or editorially select which stories to display.
- Guarantee that all manipulative language is detected or removed.

### 2.3 Service Availability

The App requires an internet connection to retrieve articles from the NTRL backend. We make reasonable efforts to maintain service availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control.

## 4. Intellectual Property

### 4.1 NTRL Intellectual Property

The NTRL application, including its design, code, neutralization engine, user interface, and branding, is the intellectual property of [TBD — Legal Entity Name]. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved.

### 4.2 Source Article Content

Articles displayed in the App are derived from content published by third-party news organizations via public RSS feeds. The original content remains the intellectual property of its respective publishers. NTRL:

- Attributes all content to its original source.
- Provides links to the original source articles.
- Processes content under principles of transformative use for the purpose of removing manipulative language.
- Does not claim ownership of source article content.

### 4.3 Neutralized Content

The neutralized versions of articles — including the specific modifications made by NTRL's neutralization engine — represent NTRL's transformative work product. You may read this content within the App but may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the neutralized output without prior written permission.

---

## 5. Content Sources and Attribution

### 5.1 Source Selection

NTRL aggregates content from RSS feeds published by established news organizations. Source selection is based on:

- Public availability of RSS feeds.
- Editorial standards of the publishing organization.
- Diversity of perspective across the news landscape.

NTRL does not editorially filter which stories appear. All articles from configured RSS sources that meet technical ingestion criteria are processed and made available.

### 5.2 Attribution

Every article in the App identifies:

- The original source publication.
- The original author, when available from the RSS feed.
- A link to the original article.

### 5.3 No Endorsement

The inclusion of content from any source does not constitute an endorsement of that source, its editorial perspective, or the accuracy of its reporting.

---

## 6. Disclaimers

### 6.1 AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

**THE NEUTRALIZED CONTENT PRESENTED IN THE APP IS GENERATED BY AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM.** While our neutralization engine is designed to remove manipulative language while preserving factual content, it is subject to the following limitations:

- The AI may fail to detect certain forms of manipulative language.
- The AI may, in rare cases, inadvertently alter the factual meaning of a passage.
- The AI's ability to process content is subject to the capabilities and limitations of the underlying language model.
- The neutralization engine is continuously being improved, but perfection is not guaranteed.

Users should not rely solely on NTRL's neutralized content for critical decisions. We encourage reading original source material, which is always linked from within the App.

### 6.2 No Fact-Checking Disclaimer

**NTRL DOES NOT FACT-CHECK, VERIFY, OR VALIDATE THE ACCURACY OF ANY CLAIMS, STATEMENTS, OR DATA CONTAINED IN THE ARTICLES IT PROCESSES.** The App's neutralization engine addresses the language and framing of articles — not the truth or accuracy of their content. A factually inaccurate article may still appear in NTRL with its manipulative language removed but its inaccurate claims intact.

### 6.3 General Disclaimer

**THE APP AND ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NTRL disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, completeness, and non-infringement.

### 6.4 Informational Purposes Only

All content in the App is provided for informational purposes only. It does not constitute professional advice of any kind, including but not limited to legal, financial, medical, or political advice.

In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion of liability set forth above, our total cumulative liability to you for all claims arising from or related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or fifty U.S. dollars ($50.00), whichever is greater.

---

## 9. Termination

### 9.1 By You

You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Because the App does not maintain user accounts (Phase 1), no further action is required.
